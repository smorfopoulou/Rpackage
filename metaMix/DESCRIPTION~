Description: Package for resolving complex metagenomic mixtures by analysing
    deep sequencing data, using a mixture model based approach. The main idea
    is that the species origin information of each read is missing, but the
    complete knowledge of all species present in the mixture helps with the
    individual reads assignment. The use of parallel Monte Carlo Markov chains
    (MCMC) for the exploration of the species space enables the identification
    of the set of species more likely to contribute to the mixture.  We
    designed our method specifically for the analysis of deep transcriptome
    sequencing datasets and with a particular focus on viral pathogen
    detection, but the principles are applicable more generally to all types of
    metagenomics mixtures.
